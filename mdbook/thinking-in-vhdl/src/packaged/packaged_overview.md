# Packaged RedPitaya Applications Overview

As well as providing the sources and build instructions for compiling the VHDL codes and 
assembling the boot images for the RedPitaya, Pavel Demin provides a zip file with 
pre-compiled codes.

These serve as a good practical introduction to the challenge of designing 7 series
applications such that they can be interoperable with general purpose computing applications.
